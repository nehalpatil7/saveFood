## Food Waste Reduction App
### Inspiration
The inspiration behind our Food Waste Reduction App stems from two critical issues: food waste and food insecurity. We observed that many restaurants and grocery stores often have surplus food that goes to waste due to lack of efficient channels for redistribution. Simultaneously, numerous individuals and families in our community struggle with food insecurity, lacking access to nutritious meals. We saw an opportunity to bridge this gap by creating a mobile app that connects surplus food providers with local food banks and community organizations.
